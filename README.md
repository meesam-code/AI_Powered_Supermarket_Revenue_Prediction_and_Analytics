**Smart Supermarket Revenue Predictor and Analysis**

This project predicts daily and monthly revenue for supermarkets using machine learning. It allows real-time and batch predictions, and presents interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends. Built with **Streamlit** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend, it is fully deployable via **Docker**, **Hugging Face Spaces**, or **Render**.
